This PR implements robust input validation and error handling for the Number Guessing Game.

**Summary:**
This PR modifies the `get_user_guess` function to validate user input, ensuring it's an integer within the specified range. It also provides informative error messages for invalid inputs.

**Motivation:**
This addresses the user story related to input validation and error handling, making the game more robust and user-friendly by preventing crashes due to invalid input and guiding the user to provide correct input.

**Detailed Changes:**
- `game.py`: The `get_user_guess` function was modified to:
    - Accept `min_range` and `max_range` as arguments.
    - Use a `try-except` block to catch `ValueError` for non-integer inputs.
    - Check if the guessed number is within the `min_range` and `max_range`.
    - Provide specific error messages for invalid integer input and out-of-range guesses.
- `test_game.py`: A new test case `test_get_user_guess` was added to cover:
    - Valid integer input.
    - Non-integer input followed by valid input.
    - Input below `min_range` followed by valid input.
    - Input above `max_range` followed by valid input.

**Testing Details:**
- Unit tests in `test_game.py` cover the updated `get_user_guess` function, including various valid and invalid input scenarios.
- **What is Tested:**
    - `get_user_guess`: Correctly handles integer input, non-integer input, and inputs outside the defined range.
    - `generate_secret_number`, `provide_feedback`, `track_guess`, `ask_to_play_again`: Existing functionality remains intact and passes all tests.
- **Edge Cases Considered:**
    - Entering non-numeric characters.
    - Entering numbers below the minimum allowed range.
    - Entering numbers above the maximum allowed range.
    - Entering valid numbers after initial invalid attempts.
- **What is NOT Tested:**
    - Integration with command-line argument parsing for `min_range` and `max_range` (this will be covered in a separate issue).
    - Comprehensive error handling for unexpected system-level input issues (e.g., I/O errors, although `try-except` for `ValueError` provides basic robustness).

**High-Level Plan:**
## High-Level Plan: Number Guessing Game Development

### 1. Description
This plan outlines the development process for the Number Guessing Game, focusing on core functionality, user interaction, and adherence to quality standards.

### 2. Proposed Technical Approach
The game will be developed in Python, utilizing the `random` module for number generation. `pytest` will be used for testing, and `ruff` for linting and formatting to ensure code quality.

### 3. Identified Subtasks (GitHub Issues)
Based on the PRD, the development will be broken down into the following key subtasks, each corresponding to a GitHub issue:

#### Subtask 1: Implement Core Game Logic
*   **Description:** Implement the fundamental game mechanics, including generating a random secret number, handling user input for guesses, providing feedback (too high, too low, correct), and tracking the number of guesses.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Game generates a random number within a default range (e.g., 1-100).
    *   Player is prompted for input.
    *   Game provides correct feedback for too high, too low, and correct guesses.
    *   Game accurately tracks and displays the number of guesses.

#### Subtask 2: Develop Game Flow and Replay Functionality
*   **Description:** Establish the overall game flow, allowing players to start a new game, play multiple rounds, and providing an option to play again after winning.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Game starts correctly.
    *   Game loop continues until the correct number is guessed.
    *   After winning, the player is asked if they want to play again.
    *   Game can be restarted for a new round.

#### Subtask 3: Add Input Validation and Error Handling
*   **Description:** Implement robust validation for user input to ensure it's a valid number and handle non-numeric or out-of-range inputs gracefully.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Non-numeric input is rejected with an informative error message.
    *   Input outside the defined range is handled appropriately (e.g., warning or rejection).
    *   Game does not crash due to invalid input.

#### Subtask 4: Set up Configuration and Testing Environment
*   **Description:** Make the number guessing range configurable (e.g., via command-line arguments) and set up the testing framework (`pytest`) and linting/formatting tool (`ruff`).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Game range can be specified via command-line arguments.
    *   `pytest` is configured and runs tests successfully.
    *   `ruff` is configured and can check/format code.
    *   Basic tests for core functionality are present.
